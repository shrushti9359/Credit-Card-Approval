# Credit-Card-Approval
Hey there! Let me walk you through our credit card approval project journey. We kicked things off with exploratory data analysis, diving deep into factors like family size, marital status, income type, age, and gender. Then, we rolled up our sleeves and employed various machine learning algorithms to predict approval accuracy. By analyzing this data, we're aiming to make smarter decisions about who gets approved for credit cards. It's all about using data to ensure fairness and reliability in our approval process, ultimately benefiting both the applicants and the company.
