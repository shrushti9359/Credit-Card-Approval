# Credit-Card-Approval
Hey there! Dive into our Credit Card Approval Project journey with me! ðŸš€ We embarked on this adventure by diving deep into the data, exploring every nook and cranny through exploratory data analysis. Then, armed with a variety of ML algorithms, we set out to predict approval outcomes based on factors like family size, marital status, income type, age, and gender. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’³ Our goal? To crack the code on who gets the green light for credit cards! With each algorithm, we're peeling back layers of insight to ensure fair and accurate approvals. Let's make financial decisions a breeze! ðŸŒŸ
